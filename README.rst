RFMIZER
=======

What this?

My first project in python/django.

This app was written for automate a SMS messaging to customers based on a RFM matrix.
The SMS is sent when a trigger works (a customer move down on a R-axis).

How works it?

Upload your database which contain deals of customers. It must be in a CSV format.
Columns must be in order bellow.

| Data Deal | Customer Name | Customer Phone | Product | Price |

At an import the app checks customers to phones.

After upload your base, heed to go into a settings of a created table and you need to set RFM settings. 
Next create rules of messaging on triggers which you need. 
Personalize your message using {name}.

A cron compute a RFM every customer at night, and if a move on the R-axis is done, the customer get a message in the day.

Summary: your have automaton which comeback your customer to you, again, and again, and your bank account full more, and more.

Attention: All the templates are implemented in russian language.

Quick start
-----------

1. Install and config PostgreSQL, create a user and a database.

2. Install Redis from there https://redis.io/.

3. Install Django and start a new project, config a backend use the Postgres credentials like this
::

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': 'db_name',
            'USER': 'user_name',
            'PASSWORD': 'user_password',
            'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
            'PORT': '5432'
        }
    }

4. Run
::

    pip install django-rfmizer

5. Add next apps to your INSTALLED_APPS in the settings.py
::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'rfmizer.apps.RfmizerConfig', # This string must be add in a first element of a the list
        '...',
        'fixture_magic',
        'multiselectfield',
        'django_celery_beat',
        ]

6. Add into the settings.py a code is below
::

    LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/profile/'

7. Add imports into urls.py
::

    from django.contrib.auth.views import LoginView
    from django.urls import include, path

8. Include the rfmizer URLconf in your project urls.py like this
::

    urlpatterns += [
        path('registration/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls', )),
        path('', include('rfmizer.urls')),
        path('login/', LoginView.as_view(redirect_authenticated_user=True),
             name='login')
    ]

9. Create a celery.py file in main directory and insert to it a code below, NAME_OF_DIRECTORY is a directory which contain this file and the settings.py
::

    import os
    from celery import Celery
    from celery.schedules import crontab

    # set the default Django settings module for the 'celery' program.
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'NAME_OF_DIRECTORY.settings')

    celery_app = Celery(
        'rfmzer',
        broker='redis://localhost:6379/0',
        backend='redis://localhost:6379/0',
        include=['rfmizer.tasks'],
    )

    # If you need, it can to be changed.
    celery_app.conf.timezone = 'UTC'

    celery_app.conf.beat_schedule = {
        'run-rfmizer-at-3-am': {
            'task': 'rfmizer.tasks.schedule_run_rfmizer',
            'schedule': crontab(hour='3', day_of_week='mon-fri')
        },
        'run-sms-sending-at-10-am': {
            'task': 'rfmizer.tasks.schedule_run_sms_sending',
            'schedule': crontab(hour='10', day_of_week='mon-fri')
        },
    }

9. Run `$ python manage.py migrate` to create the rfmizer models.

10. Run in a different terminals on server, NAME_OF_DIRECTORY is a directory which contain the celery.py. It must be run from a directory where the manage.py file is.
::

    redis-sever
    celery -A NAME_OF_DIRECTORY worker -l INFO
    celery -A NAME_OF_DIRECTORY beat -l INFO
    python manage.py runserver
